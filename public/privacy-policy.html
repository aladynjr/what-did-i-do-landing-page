    <h1>Privacy Policy for What Did I Do</h1>
    <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: November 4, 2024</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to What Did I Do ("we," "our," or "us"). This privacy policy explains how we handle your information when you use our desktop application.</p>

    <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
    <p>Our application captures screenshots of your desktop activity at intervals you specify. These screenshots are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Stored exclusively on your local device</li>
        <li>Never uploaded to any external servers</li>
        <li>Never shared with third parties</li>
        <li>Processed locally on your computer</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Data Storage</h2>
    <p>All data, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Screenshots</li>
        <li>Activity categorizations</li>
        <li>Usage statistics</li>
        <li>Application settings</li>
    </ul>
    <p>are stored locally in a database on your computer and never leave your device except for image analysis purposes described below.</p>

    <h2>4. Google Gemini API Integration</h2>
    <p>Our application uses Google's Gemini API for image analysis. When processing screenshots:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Screenshots are temporarily sent to Google's Gemini API for analysis</li>
        <li>The API helps categorize your activities</li>
        <li>After analysis, the data is not retained by Google</li>
        <li>You need to provide your own API key to use this functionality</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Security</h2>
    <p>We implement several measures to ensure your data's security:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>All data is stored locally on your device</li>
        <li>No cloud storage or synchronization</li>
        <li>Data transmission to Gemini API uses secure protocols</li>
        <li>You maintain full control over your data</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. User Control</h2>
    <p>You have full control over your data:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>You can start/stop tracking at any time</li>
        <li>You can adjust screenshot intervals</li>
        <li>You can delete your data at any time</li>
        <li>You can remove your API key when desired</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>The only third-party service we interact with is the Google Gemini API, which is used solely for image analysis. We do not share your data with any other third-party services.</p>

    <h2>8. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>All data is retained locally on your device until you choose to delete it. You can manage your data retention by:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Manually deleting screenshots</li>
        <li>Clearing the application data</li>
        <li>Uninstalling the application</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this policy.</p>

    <h2>10. Contact Information</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this privacy policy or our practices, please contact us at [Your Contact Information].</p>

    <h2>11. Children's Privacy</h2>
    <p>Our application is not intended for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.</p>

    <h2>12. Your Rights</h2>
    <p>Since all data is stored locally on your device, you maintain complete control over your information and can access, modify, or delete it at any time through the application's interface or by managing the files directly on your system.</p>
